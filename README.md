# Count
A simple web application that displays very basic information about inserted text, with some filtering options available.

Functions:
* Counts the number of characters and words.
* Replaces words with user input, with options to include and exclude embedded matches.
* Displays the most frequently used word (there needs to be more than one word present), with options to filter basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words">stopwords</a> (i.e. a, the, of) and more complex stopwords (i.e. above, behind, meanwhile).
